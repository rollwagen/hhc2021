# 3) Thaw Frost Tower's Entrance

_Difficulty:_  :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree:

Turn up the heat to defrost the entrance to Frost Tower. Click on the Items
tab in your badge to find a link to the Wifi Dongle's CLI interface. Talk to
Greasy Gopherguts outside the tower for tips.

Howdy howdy!  Mind helping me with this homew- er, challenge?
Someone ran nmap -oG on a big network and produced this bigscan.gnmap file.
The quizme program has the questions and hints and, incidentally,
has NOTHING to do with an Elf University assignment. Thanks!

Answer all the questions in the quizme executable:
- What port does 34.76.1.22 have open?
- What port does 34.77.207.226 have open?
- How many hosts appear "Up" in the scan?
- How many hosts have a web port open?  (Let's just use TCP ports 80, 443, and 8080)
- How many hosts with status Up have no (detected) open TCP ports?
- What's the greatest number of TCP ports any one host has open?

Check out bigscan.gnmap and type quizme to answer each question.
```

```bash
# What port does 34.76.1.22 have open?
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep 34.76.1.22 | grep Ports
Host: 34.76.1.22 ()  Ports: 62078/open/tcp//iphone-sync///

# What port does 34.77.207.226 have open?
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep 34.77.207.226 | grep -i open
Host: 34.77.207.226 ()     Ports: 8080/open/tcp//http-proxy///

# How many hosts appear "Up" in the scan?
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep "Up" | cut -d' ' -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l
26054

# How many hosts have a web port open?  (TCP ports 80, 443, and 8080)
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep -E "80\/open|8080\/open|443\/open" \
   | cut -d" " -f 2 | uniq | wc -l
14372
# ...alternative   grep -E "(80|443|8080)/open"

# How many hosts with status Up have no (detected) open TCP ports?
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep "Status: Up" | wc -l
26054 # number of hosts that are "Up"

$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep "Up" -A1 | wc -l
51706  # open port hosts have 2nd line "Host: 34.79.255.241 () Ports: 21/open/tcp//ftp/"

# if all hosts have open ports then number should be 26054*2 = 52108
# 52108 - 51706 = 402 number of hosts that are up but no open ports

# alternative:
# echo $((`grep Up bigscan.gnmap | wc -l` - `grep Ports bigscan.gnmap | wc -l`))

# What's the greatest number of TCP ports any one host has open?
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep -E '(.*open.*){12}' | wc -l
5
$ cat bigscan.gnmap | grep -E '(.*open.*){13}' | wc -l
0
# alternative with awk:
# awk 'BEGIN {print}{print gsub(/open/,"") ""}' bigscan.gnmap | sort -nr | head -1

Nidus Thermostat API

```text
Utilize a GET request to query information; for example, you can check the
temperatures set on your cooler with:

curl -XGET http://nidus-setup:8080/api/cooler

Utilize a POST request with a JSON payload to configuration information; for
example, you can change the temperature on your cooler using:

curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{"temperature": -40}' \
  http://nidus-setup:8080/api/cooler

WARNING: DO NOT SET THE TEMPERATURE ABOVE 0! That might melt important furniture
```

```bash
$ curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-binary '{"temperature": 0}' http://nidus-setup:8080/api/cooler
{
  "temperature": 0.96,
  "humidity": 78.11,
  "wind": 9.35,
  "windchill": -2.0,
  "WARNING": "ICE MELT DETECTED!"
}
```
