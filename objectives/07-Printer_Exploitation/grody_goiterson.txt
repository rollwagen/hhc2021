Hrmph. Snrack! Pthbthbthb.
Gnerphk. Well, on to business.
I'm Grody Goiterson. ... It's a family name.
So hey, this is the Frostavator. It runs on some logic chips... that fell out.
I put them back in, but I must have mixed them up, because it isn't working now.
If you don't know much about logic gates, it's something you should look up.
If you help me run the elevator, maybe I can help you with something else.
I'm pretty good with FPGAs, if that's worth something to ya'.
